    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the final product created for the Progabide analysis project, including the visual timeline graphic, description, and a full resource manifest. The title of the infographic was inspired by a visual investigation of why Progabide, an early GABAergic anti-seizure drug, saw early scientific enthusiasm but eventually declined in clinical and regulatory standing. An image of the Final Infographic is included below, followed by a detailed description of the timeline and a comprehensive list of resources used in its creation.\n",
